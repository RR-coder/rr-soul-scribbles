<h2>Chapter 1: The Call Before Dawn</h2>
<p>
The clock had just struck 3:47 AM when ACP Jaideep Rana’s phone buzzed violently on his bedside table.
His eyes opened instantly—sharper than most men fully awake. There was no grogginess, no delay. 
Duty had conditioned his body better than any alarm clock ever could.
</p>

<p>
“ACP Rana here,” he answered, voice steady.
</p>

<p>
“Sir, there’s been a shooting in Karol Bagh. Civilians injured. Possibly gang-related. Media's already swarming,” came the hurried voice of his SHO.
</p>

<p>
He swung his legs off the bed, eyes catching the faint light of a framed photo: his father in army uniform. 
A man of principle, like Jaideep—but one who had never approved of his son's choice to join the police.
</p>

<p>
He didn’t have time to think about that now. Within minutes, Jaideep was in his Bolero, Delhi’s still-sleeping streets rushing past as blue and red flashes reflected off empty shop shutters.
</p>

<p>
What awaited him wasn’t just a shooting. It was the first move in a game that would define the next year of his career—and his life.
