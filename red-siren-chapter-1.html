    <h1>Chapter 1: The Call Before Dawn</h1>
    <p>A new beginning for ACP Jaideep Rana</p>
  </header>
  <div class="container">
    <p>It was 4:13 a.m. The buzzing of his phone jolted ACP Jaideep Rana from his light sleep. 
    The Delhi streets were still buried under a blanket of quiet fog, but crime, he knew, didn’t sleep.</p>

    <p>He wiped his eyes and answered the call. “Sir, there’s been a murder. Vasant Kunj. And…”
    The officer hesitated. “The victim is the daughter of a retired High Court judge.”</p>

    <p>Jaideep sat up straight. He didn’t need coffee now. This case wasn’t just about justice—it was a test of his principles, 
    his training, and the promise he had made to himself the day he cleared UPSC: to serve with courage, without compromise.</p>

    <p>As he dressed, he glanced at a photo on his table—his father in army uniform, rigid, proud, distant. 
    Their last conversation had ended in silence. “Police? Not good enough,” his father had said.</p>

    <p>But Jaideep didn’t become a cop to please anyone. He did it to change the system from within. 
    The city was calling him now, and he wouldn’t let it down.</p>
