  <h1>Chapter 1: The Suicide That Wasn’t</h1>
  <h2>Genre: Crime Thriller | Setting: Delhi | Tone: Sharp, Realistic, Inspirational</h2>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 1: Amar Colony, South Delhi – July Morning</h3>
    <p>It was humid. Even the air felt like it was sweating.</p>
    <p>ACP Jai Deep Rana, posted in Delhi Crime Branch, stood inside the minimalist yet modern flat of Rhea Malhotra, 27. The AC hummed, but it couldn’t erase the heaviness of the scene.</p>
    <p>She lay on the ground — lifeless, cold, lips slightly parted. Empty bottle of sleeping pills in one hand, a half-written diary in the other.</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir… sab kuch suicide jaise hi lagta hai,” said Inspector Aditya Mishra. “Darwaza andar se band tha. Koi tod-phod nahi. Maid ne subah 6:15 pe dekha, hum 7 baje aaye…”</blockquote>
    <p>Mishra, with his Bhojpuri swagger and a half-tucked shirt, always brought rough charm to chaos. Originally from Buxar, he was more sidekick from a 90s Bihari novel than a Delhi cop — but sharp where it counted.</p>
    <p>But Jai Deep wasn’t convinced.</p>
    <p>He walked slowly toward the window and opened it.</p>
    <blockquote>“There’s no dust on the sill… but no latch marks either.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Toh?” Mishra frowned.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Toh yeh window kal raat ko saaf ki gayi hai. Kyu? Suicide karne se pehle koi window kyun saaf karega?”</blockquote>
    <p>He knelt next to Rhea’s hand. Something glinted. A fine surveillance fiber. Nearly invisible to the naked eye.</p>
    <div class="highlight">“Yeh self-inflicted nahi hai,” Jai Deep said. “This is a murder. Covered up to look clean.”</div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Flashback – Jai Deep’s Journey</h3>
    <p>As forensics arrived, Jai Deep stepped out to the balcony, sweat clinging to his back despite the early hour.</p>
    <p>His thoughts went elsewhere. His father — an Army Subedar — had once said,</p>
    <blockquote>“Police waale kya karte hain? Gunde ban jaate hain license ke saath!”</blockquote>
    <p>But Jai Deep didn’t want uniform for power. He wanted it for purification. He had lived in rented rooms the size of a godown shelf. Had studied under fans that worked only in prayer. His third UPSC attempt had broken him — but also made him.</p>
    <p>And today, he was ACP Jai Deep Rana — not because the system allowed him to be. But because he refused to let it swallow him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 2: The Trail – Rhea’s Secret Life</h3>
    <p>On the surface, Rhea was just another NGO employee.</p>
    <p>But Jai Deep found inconsistencies in her transactions. Her bank logs showed regular, small transfers from a “consulting firm” in Gurgaon — but the address led to a closed shop.</p>
    <p>When her mobile yielded nothing, Jai Deep visited her father — a retired DU professor. The room was still like a temple to memory. Her bookshelf held dusty Enid Blytons. Inside one, hidden behind brittle pages, was a slim blue notebook.</p>
    <p>The entries made Jai Deep’s pulse quicken:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shell firms</li>
      <li>Black money</li>
      <li>Experimental drug trials</li>
      <li>Fund transfers from government accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All roads led to Jain Pharma.</p>
    <blockquote>“Murder to pehla step tha sir,” Mishra murmured. “Yeh toh jungle hai.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 3: Action – The Arrest Operation</h3>
    <p>Jai Deep filed for a warrant to arrest Rishabh Jain, son of business magnate Prakash Jain. But two days passed. Then three. The file never reached the magistrate.</p>
    <blockquote>“System mein kahin bhi nahi mil raha,” said the clerk.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Mil raha hoga Rawat ke table pe,” Mishra added. “MLA Rawat ne haath ghumaya hai… Par hum bhi Bihar ke hain, sir. Ego mein justice dhoond lete hain.”</blockquote>
    <p>A tip-off came — Rishabh was hosting a rave at a Chattarpur farmhouse. Without waiting for fresh paperwork, Jai Deep mobilized his team.</p>
    <h4> Raid Night – Chattarpur</h4>
    <p>High boundary walls. Z-plus security. The muffled thump of bass-heavy EDM leaked into the humid Chattarpur air.</p>
    <p>ACP Jai Deep Rana crouched behind a neem tree near the rear wall, eyes scanning the perimeter.</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir,” whispered Mishra ji, panting slightly, “ee log toh rave karat hain... lekin andar kuch aur hi pak raha hai.”</blockquote>
    <p>They hoisted themselves up the compound wall with a grappling hook. Inside, a flashlight swept past.</p>
    <blockquote>“Move!” Jai Deep gestured.</blockquote>
    <p>Near the side entrance, a service gate clicked open. A man stepped out to vomit. Mishra whispered:</p>
    <blockquote>“Chillaile toh party ke andar hi thanda kar denge... samjha?”</blockquote>
    <p>Inside, laser lights sliced the air. Champagne flowed. Politician’s kids danced. Mishra scanned the bar.</p>
    <blockquote>“Rave nahi hai, sir,” Mishra leaned in, “Yeh toh system ke beta party hai.”</blockquote>
    <p>They reached a hallway marked "Private Access." Two guards stood at the door.</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir, direct takkar lete hain?”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Too loud. Make it clean.”</blockquote>
    <p>Mishra distracted them with a scotch bottle. Deepender struck one. Jai Deep caught the other’s rifle mid-air.</p>
    <p>Behind the hidden bookshelf — a server room. Red indicator lights blinked.</p>
    <blockquote>“This isn’t just storage. It’s a brain,” Jai Deep muttered.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Sir… ee toh RAW waale log bhi nahi dekh paate aise data room!”</blockquote>
    <p>He found a video of Rishabh threatening Rhea.</p>
    <blockquote>“Tu samajhti kya hai? Main MLA Rawat ka aadmi hoon!”</blockquote>
    <p>He backed it up. A screen blinked: <strong>🟥 “Grey List – Internal Leaks / Media Contacts / Embedded Assets”</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 4: Courtroom Showdown</h3>
    <p>Tis Hazari Court – 3 Days Later. Rishabh tried to look like an obedient son. Judge Sharma reviewed the file.</p>
    <blockquote>“You’re saying the death was made to look like suicide?”</blockquote>
    <p>Jai Deep handed over forensic proof, notebook, and digital recordings.</p>
    <blockquote>“We have motive, method, and voice.”</blockquote>
    <p>The lawyer objected. Jai Deep replied:</p>
    <blockquote>“Because the lab was told to delay it! Orders came from MLA Rawat’s office.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Bail is denied. Accused to be remanded to Tihar Jail. Rawat’s office will be investigated independently.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Game badal gaya, sir.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Game toh ab shuru hua hai.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 5: Shadow Over the Hero</h3>
    <p>Inside a surveillance room, a man rewound courtroom footage. He ordered:</p>
    <blockquote>“Start monitoring him. He’s not going to stop. Time to push back.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 6: Rhea’s Final Move</h3>
    <p>Gwalior – Professor Dr. Isha Singh received a registered envelope from Delhi. Inside — a pen drive and note:</p>
    <blockquote>“If anything happens to me, this drive has names. Not just Jain. But bureaucrats. Police. Officers. This goes only to ACP Jai Deep Rana. No one else.”</blockquote>
    <p>The folder: <strong>🟥 GREY LIST – Candidates / Corrupt / Embedded in System</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Final Scene: The Next Case Begins</h3>
    <p>Back in Delhi, Jai Deep received the pen drive. Just then, a new case:</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir, Hauz Khas museum mein chori. Rare idol gayab. FIR ho gaya.”</blockquote>
    <p>He stood. Mishra shouted:</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir! Ee toh naya case lagta hai… lekin chori simple nahi lagti!”</blockquote>
    <p>Jai Deep smirked. <strong>“Let’s go. Red Siren Diaries ka agla page likhna hai.”</strong></p>
