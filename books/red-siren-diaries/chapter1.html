  <h1>Chapter 1: The Suicide That Wasn’t</h1>
  <h2>Genre: Crime Thriller | Setting: Delhi | Tone: Sharp, Realistic, Inspirational</h2>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 1: Amar Colony, South Delhi – July Morning</h3>
    <p>It was humid. Even the air felt like it was sweating.</p>
    <p>ACP Jai Deep Rana, posted in Delhi Crime Branch, stood inside the minimalist yet modern flat of Rhea Malhotra, 27. The AC hummed, but it couldn’t erase the heaviness of the scene.</p>
    <p>She lay on the ground — lifeless, cold, lips slightly parted. Empty bottle of sleeping pills in one hand, a half-written diary in the other.</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir… sab kuch suicide jaise hi lagta hai,”</blockquote>
    <p>said Inspector Aditya Mishra, also known across the department as Mishra ji. “Darwaza andar se band tha. Koi tod-phod nahi. Maid ne subah 6:15 pe dekha, hum 7 baje aaye…”</p>
    <p>Mishra, with his Bhojpuri swagger and a half-tucked shirt, always brought rough charm to chaos. Originally from Buxar, he was more sidekick from a 90s Bihari novel than a Delhi cop — but sharp where it counted.</p>
    <p>But Jai Deep wasn’t convinced.</p>
    <p>He walked slowly toward the window and opened it.</p>
    <blockquote>“There’s no dust on the sill… but no latch marks either.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Toh?” Mishra frowned.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Toh yeh window kal raat ko saaf ki gayi hai. Kyu? Suicide karne se pehle koi window kyun saaf karega?”</blockquote>
    <p>He knelt next to Rhea’s hand. Something glinted. A fine surveillance fiber. Nearly invisible to the naked eye.</p>
    <div class="highlight">“Yeh self-inflicted nahi hai,” Jai Deep said. “This is a murder. Covered up to look clean.”</div>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Flashback – Jai Deep’s Journey</h3>
    <p>As forensics arrived, Jai Deep stepped out to the balcony, sweat clinging to his back despite the early hour.</p>
    <p>His thoughts went elsewhere. His father — an Army Subedar — had once said,</p>
    <blockquote>“Police waale kya karte hain? Gunde ban jaate hain license ke saath!”</blockquote>
    <p>The words had cut deep.</p>
    <p>But Jai Deep didn’t want uniform for power. He wanted it for purification. He had lived in rented rooms the size of a godown shelf. Had studied under fans that worked only in prayer. His third UPSC attempt had broken him — but also made him.</p>
    <p>And today, he was ACP Jai Deep Rana — not because the system allowed him to be. But because he refused to let it swallow him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 2: The Trail – Rhea’s Secret Life</h3>
    <p>On the surface, Rhea was just another NGO employee.</p>
    <p>But Jai Deep found inconsistencies in her transactions. Her bank logs showed regular, small transfers from a “consulting firm” in Gurgaon — but the address led to a closed shop.</p>
    <p>When her mobile yielded nothing, Jai Deep visited her father — a retired DU professor. The room was still like a temple to memory. Her bookshelf held dusty Enid Blytons.</p>
    <p>Inside one, hidden behind brittle pages, was a slim blue notebook.</p>
    <p>The entries made Jai Deep’s pulse quicken:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shell firms</li>
      <li>Black money</li>
      <li>Experimental drug trials</li>
      <li>Fund transfers from government accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All roads led to Jain Pharma.</p>
    <blockquote>“Murder to pehla step tha sir,” Mishra murmured. “Yeh toh jungle hai.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 3: Action – The Arrest Operation</h3>
    <p>Jai Deep filed for a warrant to arrest Rishabh Jain, son of business magnate Prakash Jain. But two days passed. Then three. The file never reached the magistrate.</p>
    <blockquote>“System mein kahin bhi nahi mil raha,” said the clerk.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Mil raha hoga Rawat ke table pe,” Mishra added. “MLA Rawat ne haath ghumaya hai… Par hum bhi Bihar ke hain, sir. Ego mein justice dhoond lete hain.”</blockquote>
    <p>A tip-off came — Rishabh was hosting a rave at a Chattarpur farmhouse. Without waiting for fresh paperwork, Jai Deep mobilized his team.</p>

    <h4>🔥 Raid Night – Chattarpur</h4>
    <p>High boundary walls. Z-plus security. The muffled thump of bass-heavy EDM leaked into the humid Chattarpur air.</p>
    <p>ACP Jai Deep Rana crouched behind a neem tree near the rear wall, eyes scanning the perimeter.</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir,” whispered Mishra ji, panting slightly, “ee log toh rave karat hain... lekin andar kuch aur hi pak raha hai.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Rave toh cover hai. We go in low and silent.”</blockquote>
    <p>They hoisted themselves up the wall. Once inside, they navigated past guards and distractions. Mishra used confiscated scotch to distract guards while the others disabled them.</p>
    <p>Behind a fake bookshelf, they discovered a hidden server room glowing with red lights.</p>
    <blockquote>“This isn’t just storage. It’s a brain,” Jai Deep muttered.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Sir… ee toh RAW waale log bhi nahi dekh paate aise data room!”</blockquote>
    <p>Security footage played — Rishabh Jain threatening Rhea:</p>
    <blockquote>“Tu samajhti kya hai? Main MLA Rawat ka aadmi hoon! Agar kuch bola toh tujhe aur tere family ko khatam kar dunga!”</blockquote>
    <p>Jai Deep saved the video, backed up the drive, and photographed a file labeled:</p>
    <code>🟥 Grey List – Internal Leaks / Media Contacts / Embedded Assets</code>
    <blockquote>“We’re coming back for this.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 4: Courtroom Showdown</h3>
    <p><strong>Tis Hazari Court – 3 Days Later</strong></p>
    <p>The courtroom was tense. Media outside. Political aides inside.</p>
    <p>Judge Sharma looked up. “You’re saying the death was made to look like suicide?”</p>
    <blockquote>“Yes, My Lord,” Jai Deep said.</blockquote>
    <p>He presented the fiber, notebook, and video evidence. The defense cried fabrication.</p>
    <blockquote>“Because the lab was told to delay it! Orders came from MLA Rawat’s office,” Jai Deep snapped.</blockquote>
    <p>Judge Sharma denied bail and ordered immediate forensic action. MLA Rawat’s name was noted for investigation.</p>
    <blockquote>“Game badal gaya, sir.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Game toh ab shuru hua hai.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 5: Shadow Over the Hero</h3>
    <p>Inside a black surveillance room, a figure rewound courtroom footage.</p>
    <blockquote>“ACP Jai Deep Rana… Start monitoring him.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Scene 6: Rhea’s Final Move</h3>
    <p><strong>Gwalior – A Quiet Campus Office</strong></p>
    <p>Professor Dr. Isha Singh received a pen drive and handwritten note:</p>
    <blockquote>“If anything happens to me, this drive has names. This goes only to ACP Jai Deep Rana.”</blockquote>
    <code>🟥 GREY LIST – Candidates / Corrupt / Embedded in System</code>
  </div>

  <div class="scene">
    <h3>Final Scene: The Next Case Begins</h3>
    <p>Back in Delhi, Jai Deep received the pen drive from Mishra ji just as a new case arrived — rare idol stolen from Hauz Khas museum.</p>
    <blockquote>“Sir! Ee toh naya case lagta hai… lekin chori simple nahi lagti!”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Let’s go. Red Siren Diaries ka agla page likhna hai.”</blockquote>
    <div class="highlight">✅ Chapter 1: Case Closed<br>But the war has just begun.</div>
