    <h1>Red Siren Diaries - Chapter 1</h1>
    <p>The red glow sliced through the foggy Delhi morning as ACP Jaideep Rana zipped his jacket and stepped out of his black Scorpio. Hauz Khas was unusually silent — no honking, no chai stalls open, just the sound of a distant siren echoing down the alley.</p>

    <p>At just 26, Jaideep had earned the stars on his shoulder through sheer grit. From a middle-class household, a father in the army who didn’t approve of his police dreams, to finally cracking the UPSC in his third attempt after B.Tech — his journey was never ordinary.</p>

    <p>But this case wasn’t either.</p>

    <p>A politician’s son found dead in an abandoned ambulance, engine running, siren screaming. And no CCTV footage.</p>

    <p>"Sir, no sign of forced entry," said Inspector Mehra, already at the scene.</p>

    <p>Jaideep crouched near the ambulance. His sharp eyes scanned the blood-stained stretcher, the perfectly coiled IV tubes, and a small sticker on the dashboard — a saffron lotus with a QR code. That wasn’t hospital standard.</p>

    <p>Something was off. This wasn’t a murder out of rage. It was a message.</p>

    <p>He called for the cyber team and the forensics. While the body was being moved, Jaideep noticed scratch marks on the victim’s wrist — someone tried to free himself. There was a camera installed in the ambulance, but the footage had been wiped clean. Professionally.</p>

    <p>Hours later, the lab results arrived. No sign of drugs or alcohol, but a unique sedative compound was detected — used only by military-grade agencies.</p>

    <p>"Sir," the cyber expert said, "That QR code links to an anonymous blog. Last updated just today. The post says: 'Operation Red Siren begins. This is just the first.'"</p>

    <p>"Whoever did this," Jaideep muttered, "knows how to use fear as a weapon. And they want to play."</p>

    <p>By evening, a minister held a press conference calling it an accident. Jaideep's seniors asked him to step back from the investigation.</p>

    <p>He didn’t.</p>

    <p>At night, another siren blared across South Delhi. Another ambulance. Another body.</p>

    <p>The game had begun.</p>
